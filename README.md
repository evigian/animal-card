My first project for the Frond-End Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.

This project was the first assignment for the Frond-End Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.
It was initially created during the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship but it was modified 
a little for the Nanodegree program.

The project is published here: https://evigian.github.io/animal-card/
